# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey of learning **Python from fundamentals to real-world applications**.  
The goal of this repo is to track progress, practice concepts, and build a strong foundation.

I focus on **understanding concepts deeply**, writing my own code, refactoring projects, and learning by doing.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build strong Python fundamentals
- Write clean and readable code
- Understand *why* code works, not just *how*
- Create small projects and refactor them
- Prepare for internships / entry-level Python roles
